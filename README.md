# Shane Acoveno - Frontend Coding Challenge 
## Design Notes
* I utilized create react app as a boilerplate for this project
* Styling was implemented with styled-components along with TypeScript
* I took advantage of the npm validator library to validate usernames and passwords to save time
* I did not actively implement many tests however I did research Jest and the React Testing Library for future use/implementation
## To Run
* npm install
* npm start
* navigate to localhost:3000
